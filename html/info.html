        <p>
            In this page we will describe how our calculator works. To do so, we are going to save a recipe for an
            Apple Pie, step by step. Then, we will calculate the insulin dose needed for a certain quantity of Apple Pie, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Please note that the calculations are approximated. Use with caution.</strong>

        <p>
            Here is the list of ingredients we are going to use:</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>First of all, head over to <em><a href="ingredients.php">Your Ingredients</a></em> section and save the
            new ingredients by filling in the necessary information and clicking the <em>Save New Ingredient</em>
            button.</p>
        <p>
            For each ingredient
            insert its name and the quantity of carbohydrates (<em>carbs</em> for short) in 100g of product. You can
            find this information in the nutritional table on the product’s package. The value we are interested in
            is the quantity of carbs, and <strong>not</strong> the quantity of sugars. Here is an example of a
            nutritional table you can find on a bag of cookies:
        </p>
            


                <table>

        <p>
            If you fail finding this information, or if the product does
            not come in a package, try looking it up on <a href="https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/">Calorie
                King</a> or simply
            <a href="http://www.google.com">google it</a>.<img alt="Find calorie info" src="img/instructions/2.png" />
            For example, all-purpose flour contains approximately 73g of carbs
            in 100g of flour, so saving the new ingredient will look like this:<img alt="Add ingredient form"
                src="img/instructions/3.png" /> On the other hand, unsalted butter has less than 1g of carbs in 100g
            of product. In this case butter is irrelevant for our calculations but we are going to insert it anyway
            for the sake of completeness.
            <em><a href="ingredients.php">Your Ingredients</a></em> section should now look like this:<img alt="Ingredients list"
                src="img/instructions/4.png" /> After you are done saving the ingredients we can proceed making the
            recipe. To do so, open the <em><a href="calculator.php">Calculator</a></em> either by clicking
            the Calculator button or by clicking the <em>Make a New Recipe</em> button in
            <em><a href="recipes.php">Your Recipes</a></em> section.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Calculator</h2>
        <p>
            Initially the recipe in the Calculator is empty and we need to <strong>add the
                ingredients</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            In the Calculator window you can see a dropdown list. Click on the list
            and <strong>pick the ingredients</strong> you just created, one
            by one. Notice that a new card appears for each ingredient, like so: <img
                alt="Ingredient card in calcluator" src="img/instructions/5.png" />
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Fields</h2>
        <p>
            Each card is composed of four sections. The first section contains the <strong>name of the
                ingredient</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            The Nutrition Facts section contains the quantity of <strong>carbs in 100g
                of product</strong>, which is the information you inserted before. These two sections are already
            filled out when you insert the ingredient from the dropdown list.
            <img alt="Nutrition facts section" src="img/instructions/6.png" /> The Grammage section is the most
            important one. In the <em>Grams</em> field insert the <strong>quantity of ingredient</strong> needed for
            your recipe. For example, we need 440g of apples
            for our Apple Pie, so we will insert the number 440 in the <em>Grams</em> field. Note that the
            <em>Insulin Units</em> field, on the right, now contains a value. This value represents the <strong>dose
                of insulin required</strong> for 440g of apples. This is perhaps
            the value you will care about the most.<img alt="Grammage section" src="img/instructions/7.png" /> The
            last section allows you to cut your ingredient into a number of pieces. Press the plus button to
            increase the number of pieces or directly
            write in the number in the <em>Pieces</em> field. Note that the table now contains three values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>carbs: the quantity of carbs of one piece measured in grams;</li>
            <li>grams: the weight of one piece measured in grams;</li>
            <li>units: the insulin units needed for one piece.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This sections is not particularly interesting at the moment, but it will be soon!<img
                alt="Divided-in section" src="img/instructions/8.png" /> Note that liquids, for example milk, are
            measured in <em>milliliters</em> and not in <em>grams</em>,
            but don't worry, it is the proportion between the Nutritional Facts data that counts, and not the unit
            of measurement, therefore the calculator can be used for liquids as well!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            After inserting all the ingredients your calculator should look like this:<img
                alt="All ingredients cards in calculator" src="img/instructions/9.png" /> Now that we have inserted
            all the ingredients in the Calculator it’s time to combine them together!
            On the bottom of the page you can see the <strong>calculator’s control panel</strong>. Find the
            <em>Combine</em> button and click it. A new ingredient-like card will be shown. This card describes your
            recipe as a homogeneous combination of
            ingredients or, simply put, it describes the recipe as a single ingredient/product. We still haven’t
            saved our recipe though. To do so, insert the name “Grandma’s Apple Pie” in the <em>Recipe Name</em>
            field of the card and click the <em>Save</em> button.
            <img alt="Recipe card" src="img/instructions/10.png" /> The recipe has now been saved and can be found
            in <em><a href="recipes.php">Your Recipes</a></em> section.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Recipe fields</h2>
        <p>
            Now let's look closely at the Recipe card that was displayed in the calculator.</p>
        <p>
            In the Nutrition
            Facts section the Calculator has automatically calculated the nutritional facts of our Apple Pie, based
            on the ingredients data we inserted
            before. </p>
        <p>
            The Grammage section is the most important part of the whole Calculator. Here you can
            <strong> calculate the dose of insulin units</strong> you need to inject for eating a certain quantity
            of Apple Pie, and <strong> vice versa</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            Let’s say you plan on eating 50g of Apple Pie. Insert 50 in the Grammage field and note that the Insulin
            Units field now
            contains 1.51. This means that for 50 grams of Apple Pie you need to inject 1.63 units of insulin. <img
                alt="Calculation from grams" src="img/instructions/11.png" /> 1.63 units is not very useful though,
            as you can not inject half a
            unit. In this case, you could for example decide to eat the equivalent of 2 insulin units. No problem,
            just insert the number of insulin units you plan on injecting in the <em>Insulin Units</em> field. The
            <em>Grams</em> field will then tell you how much Apple
            Pie to eat for that particular dose of insulin.</p>
        <p>
            Insert the number 2 in the Insulin Units field and
            note that the Grammage field contains the number 61. This means that if you inject 2 insulin units you
            need to eat approximately 60g of Apple Pie. Cool, right?
            <img alt="Calculation from insulin units" src="img/instructions/12.png" /> You can also apply the same
            procedure if you follow a strict diet and the quantity of food you eat depends on a fixed dose of
            insulin.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Pieces number</h2>
        <p>
            The last section allows you to cut the Apple Pie into pieces. Before we do that though, we need to tell
            the Calculator how much of the Apple Pie we actually have, exactly as we did before with the
            ingredients. Insert the grammage of your Apple Pie in
            the Grammage field. If you haven't already eaten any of the Apple Pie then the grammage is equivalent to
            the sum of the ingredients grammages. This sum has already been automatically calculated in the
            Nutrition Facts section of the Recipe
            card. If you haven't eaten any of the Apple Pie yet, insert 782 in the Grammage Field in the Grammage
            section, otherwise weigh how much of the apple cake you have left and insert that value in the Grammage
            Field. <img alt="Recipe all grams selected" src="img/instructions/14.png" /> One way to use the last
            section is to <strong> determine the number of pieces you need to cut your cake into</strong> in order
            to have a certain dose of <strong>insulin for each piece</strong>. Let’s say you
            want every piece of pie to require approximately 2 insulin units. Click on the plus sign to increase the
            number of pieces until every piece requires approximately 2 insulin units. In our case, you would need
            to cut the Apple Pie into 12 equivalent
            pieces in order for each piece to require 2 insuilin units approximately. Moreover, each piece should
            weight approximately 65 grams and has approximately 25 grams of carbs in it.
            <img alt="Divided in pieces" src="img/instructions/15.png" /> You could also use this section is to
            <strong>calculate the information for every piece</strong> given the number of pieces you have already
            cut your cake into. Please note that
            for the Calculator to work properly you need to make homogeneous recipes, which means that all the
            ingredients need to be evenly distributed in the recipe. For example, a piece of pie with an apple on
            top of it will have more carbs than a
            piece of pie without an apple, which is not what we want.</p>
        <p>
            This section can be particularly useful if you buy a product that has many ingredients inside of it as
            well. Imagine you buy a package of cookies and you want to know the information about each cookie.
            Insert the nutritional facts and the grammage of the the whole package, as we saw before, and then
            insert the number of cookies in the <em>Pieces</em> field. There you go, you now have the relevant
            information for each cookie in the table.</p>
