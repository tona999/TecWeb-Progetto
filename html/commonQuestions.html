                <p>
                    People with type 1 diabetes do not have the ability to produce insulin.
                    People with type 2 diabetes don't respond to insulin as well as they should and later in the disease
                    often don't make enough insulin.</p>

                <p>
                    Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body is unable to regulate the sugar levels in the
                    blood.
                    It requires constant monitoring of blood sugar levels, managing food intake, exercise, and more.
                    It is also known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What does chronic mean?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    A chronic disease is a disease that persists for a long time.
                    Chronic diseases generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medication, nor do they just
                    disappear.

            <dt>How does type 1 diabetes work?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    The food you eat and the drinks you drink are processed by your digestive system. Here all the
                    nutrients, like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals, are extracted from the food
                    and
                    broken into small parts.
                    These parts are then passed on to all the cells in your body through your blood, where they are used
                    for
                    energy, growth, and cell repair.</p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>carbohydrates</strong> are the nutrients we are most interested in. They are broken up,
                    turned into <strong>glucose</strong> (sugar), and sent into the bloodstream. Your body uses glucose
                    for
                    energy.</p>
                <p>

                    Now, imagine that the cells are locked and the glucose needs a key to enter the cells in order to be
                    consumed. That key is the <strong>insulin hormone.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    People with type 1 diabetes do not produce this hormone, therefore the glucose can not enter the
                    cells
                    and stays in the bloodstream.
                    Over time, big amounts of glucose are collected in the blood, which can potentially damage many
                    organs,
                    such as the heart, the kidneys, the brain and the eyes.
                    Consequently, your body needs to find alternative ways to get the energy it needs.</p>
                <p>

                    The body will try hard to remove the glucose through the urine, but it won't be enough.
                    As a consequence, manual insulin injection is required in order to allow the glucose to be consumed
                    by
                    the cells and be removed from the bloodstream.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Why doesn't the body produce insulin?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Our immune system defends our bodies against infections and viruses.
                    However, in people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly recognises the insulin
                    producing
                    cells as bad cells.
                    It then causes an immune response, attacking and destroying them permanently, irreversibly damaging
                    the
                    insulin production process.</p>
                <p>
                    These cells are called <strong>beta cells</strong> and are located in the <strong>pancreas</strong>.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What causes the immune response?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    According to the <em>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</em>, the
                    immune
                    system response is caused by genes and factors in the environment, such as viruses, that might
                    trigger
                    the disease.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>At what age can you get type 1 diabetes?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Type 1 diabetes is much less common than type 2 diabetes and typically arises in children.
                    Type 1 diabetes usually begins before 40 years of age, although occasionally people have been
                    diagnosed
                    at an older age.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Is there a cure for type 1 diabetes?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    <strong>Currently there is no cure for type 1 diabetes.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In order to find a cure, we would need to solve 2 problems:</p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we would need to find a way to regenerate the already destroyed beta cells. This problem has
                    been partially solved by <em>pancreatic islets transplantation</em>.
                    In this procedure, groups of beta cells, also called pancreatic islets, are transplanted from a
                    deceased donor into a diabetic patient. These cells then start producing insulin as they would in a
                    healthy person.</p>
                <p>
                    But here arises the second problem. The immune system will attack the new cells and destroy them
                    again.
                    This problem has also been partially solved by giving patients immunosuppressants which weakens the
                    immune system and stops it from attacking the bad cells.
                    This process introduces generic health risks as the body is no longer protected against very common
                    infections and viruses. </p>
                <p>
                    Alternative solutions are being constantly tested, like genetically-modified laboratory grown beta
                    cells that the immune system would not recognise and therefore would not destroy.

                    These studies, as promising as they are, are still in their early stages. You can read more about
                    them on <a

            <dt>How is type 1 diabetes treated?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    The treatment consists of injecting insulin before eating. This allows glucose to be consumed by
                    your
                    body and removed from your blood.
                    Insulin is measured in units. You can <strong>not</strong> inject fractions of a unit.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>How many types of insulin are there?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    There are six main types of insulin available:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rapid-acting</li>
                    <li>Regular (short-acting)</li>
                    <li>Intermediate-acting</li>
                    <li>Long-acting</li>
                    <li>Ultra long-acting</li>
                    <li>Combinations/pre-mixed</li>
                    <li>Inhaled insulin</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most people will only need to use 2 of them though, a short-acting and a long-acting one.</p>
                <p>
                    Short-acting insulin is injected before meals.</p>
                <p>
                    Long-acting insulin is injected before going to sleep or after waking up and lasts for up to 24
                    hours.</p>
                <p>
                    For each category there are different brands. If you have any health issues that you think might be
                    related to the insulin you use, please talk to your doctor.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>How do I measure the current glucose level in my blood?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    The level of glucose in the blood can be measured by applying a drop of blood to a chemically
                    treated,
                    disposable test-strip, which is then inserted into an electronic blood glucose meter.
                    The reaction between the test strip and the blood is detected by the meter and displayed in units of
                    <strong>mg/dL</strong> or <strong>mmol/L</strong>.
                    There are a number of different types of meters available, and all are slightly different.</p>
                <p>
                    Some patients might prefer, or might need, <strong>Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)</strong>
                    devices.
                    CGM devices allow you to track glucose levels throughout the day and night through a small sensor
                    attached to your body.
                    Some of the most advanced ones can communicate the data measured to your smartphone and alert you in
                    real time if they detect low blood sugar.</p>
                <p>
                    One of the best established CGM devices manufacturer is <a

            <dt>When should I measure blood glucose?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    You usually measure blood glucose before eating to accurately determine the insulin dose.
                    Blood glucose should be measured whenever you are feeling unwell in any way.
                    In newly diagnosed diabetes patients, more frequent measurements are needed, until blood glucose is
                    stable.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>How do I calculate the insulin dose needed for a certain meal?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The number of <strong>insulin units</strong> to inject before each meal depends on the amount of
                    carbohydrates in the food you are going to eat and on your current glucose level.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>For each 12 grams of carbohydrates you eat you will need to inject 1 insulin
                        unit</strong>.</p>
                <p>
                    You can easily check the quantity of carbs in your food in the nutritional table printed on the
                    product's package.
                    For instance, 100ml of milk have approximately 5ml of carbohydrates.</p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, 100g of dry pasta have approximately 75g of carbohydrates.</p>
                <p>
                    Please note that the value we need is the amount of carbohydrates in 100g of product, and
                    <strong>not</strong> the amount of sugar.</p>
                <p>
                    Now, as an example, let's calculate the insulin dose needed for 80g of pasta.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>insulin units = (grams you eat * carbs in 100g) / (1200) = (80 * 75) / (1200) = 5 insulin
                        units</strong>;</p>
                <p>
                    Easy, right? Well, our <a href="calculator.php">calculator</a> makes it even easier, allowing you to
                    easily calculate the insulin dose of <strong>complex recipes with many ingredients!</strong> </p>

                    Injecting too much insulin may cause your blood glucose to drop too low, causing
                    <strong>hypoglycemia</strong>.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What is hypoglycemia?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Hypoglycemia, often called "hypo" and largely known as low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to
                    levels below normal, that is 70 mg/dL or 3.9 mmol/L.
                    This may result in a variety of symptoms including weakness, clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion,
                    loss of consciousness, seizures and even death if not treated quickly.
                    A feeling of hunger, sweating, shakiness, diziness and hunger may also be present.
                    Hypoglycemia can also occur if you exercise more than you normally do.
                    To raise your glucose levels during an episode of hypoglycemia simply eat or drink something sweet,
                    like
                    a bar of chocolate or a coke.
                    The quickest way to recover from hypoglycemia is by absorbing some sugar directly through your
                    tongue.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What happens if I inject less insulin than I need?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Injecting too little insulin may cause your blood glucose to rise above healthy levels, causing
                    <strong>hyperglycemia</strong>.
                    As opposed to hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia is dangerous for your health if it lasts for a longer time
                    and
                    does not occur as easily as hypoglycemia.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What is hyperglycemia?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Hyperglycemia is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in your blood.
                    This is generally a blood sugar level higher than 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), but symptoms may not
                    start to
                    become noticeable until even higher values.</p>
                <p>
                    Early signs include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased thirst</li>
                    <li>Headaches</li>
                    <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
                    <li>Blurred vision</li>
                    <li>Frequent peeing</li>
                    <li>Weakness</li>
                    <li>Weight loss</li>

            <dt>Which glucose level ranges are healthy for a diabetic patient?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    In the morning it is good to have between 5 and 7 mmol/l or 90 and 120mg/dl.</p>
                <p>
                    Before meals a normal blood glucose range is 5-7mmol/l or 70–130 mg/dl.</p>
                <p>
                    One to two hours after meals, a blood sugar reading at or under 180 mg/dl is recommended.</p>

            <dt>How long before eating should I inject insulin?</dt>
            <dd>

                    Inject insulin right before eating. Injecting it too early can cause sugar levels to drop before you
                    start digesting the food.</p>

            <dt>Should I inject insulin to lower my glucose levels without eating?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    No. If your glucose is high you could inject a little more insulin during a meal in order to lower
                    it.</p>

            <dt>What can I eat?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    You can eat anythhing. What matters is learning to balance your meals and finding foods that are
                    healthy
                    for you.</p>

                    Some people with diabetes need to eat at about the same time each day. Others can be more flexible
                    with
                    the timing of their meals.
                    Depending on your diabetes medicines or type of insulin, you may need to eat the same amount of
                    carbohydrates at the same time each day.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Can I drink alcohol?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Yes, but make sure you have some carbs to eat before or while you drink, as alcohol may cause a
                    glucose
                    levels drop in some people.
                    Also, please do not drink too much. Episodes of hypoglycemia are easier to manage with a
                    concentrated
                    mind.</p>

            <dt>Can I replace insulin with medication in the future?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    No. As we said before, insulin is fundamental in the glucose regulation process.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Will i need other medication in addition to insulin?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Maybe, but in most of the cases you can manage diabetes with insulin, a healthy diet, exercise and
                    regular blood glucose control.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Can I do sport?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Absolutely yes. Sport is a must in order to keep a healthy lifestyle. Doing sport consumes energy
                    though, so you might need to eat something before doing it.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Do I need to visit a doctor often?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    No. If you can manage your glucose levels by yourself, you won't need to visit a doctor at all.
                    However, if you have any health issues which you think can be related to diabetes, you should
                    immediately visit your doctor.
                    They could for example suggest you a change in your diet, in your injection schedule or a change of
                    insulin brand.</p>

            <dt>How does type 1 diabetes affect pregnancy?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    You can have a healthy pregnancy with type 1 diabetes, although managing your diabetes might be
                    harder.
                    It's important to have good blood sugar control before and during pregnancy. For such delicate
                    topics,
                    please talk directly to your doctor.</p>
