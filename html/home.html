            Living with type 1 diabetes can often be challenging. In order to live a healthy life, people with diabetes need to constantly
            monitor their blood glucose and manage their diet.
            Diabetes treatment primarily consists of injecting insulin before meals.
            The amount of insulin to inject mainly depends on the quantity of carbohydrates in the food you eat.
