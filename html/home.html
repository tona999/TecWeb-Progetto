    <h2> What is diabetes? </h2>
    <p> Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar,
        levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat.
        Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells 
        to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make 
        insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body 
        does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin,
        the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes.
        This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but
        not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes 
        puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. </p>
